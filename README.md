# landing-page
A landing page made with HTML and CSS about robotic squirrels

[See it live here](https://mbeckdev.github.io/landing-page/)

If a robotic squirrel product existed, this would be it's landing page.

## What's cool about this project?
- I embedded a video to practice some CSS
- Created some CSS art.  The little icons of the blocks, truck, and check mark are made out of pure CSS.
- Robots. (Robots are cool. haha)
